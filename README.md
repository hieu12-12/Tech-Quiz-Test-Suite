## Description

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that serves as an interactive Python programming quiz. The application fetches random Python programming questions from a MongoDB database and presents them to users in a clean, interactive interface. Users can test their Python knowledge, track their scores, and retake quizzes as needed.

## Features

- Random selection of Python programming questions
- Multiple-choice answer format
- Real-time score tracking
- Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- Ability to restart the quiz with new questions
- MongoDB integration for question storage

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React.js (with TypeScript)
- Bootstrap for styling
- Vite.js for build tooling and development server

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

### Testing
- Cypress for end-to-end and component testing

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-quiz-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install dependencies for both the client and server.

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
   ```
   cd server
   cp .env.EXAMPLE .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file to include your MongoDB connection URI:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/techquiz'
   ```
   
   Note: You'll need MongoDB installed and running locally, or you can use a cloud MongoDB service.

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

```
npm run start:dev
```

This will:
- Start the Express server in watch mode
- Start the React development server with Vite
- Connect to your MongoDB database

The application will be available at http://localhost:3001

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```
npm start
```

## Database Setup

Seed the database with Python questions:

```
npm run seed
```

This will populate your MongoDB with a series of Python-related questions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into client and server directories:

```

└── ...
```

## Testing

The application includes Cypress tests for both component testing and end-to-end testing.

Run the tests:

```
npm test
```

This will execute both the component tests and the end-to-end tests.

### Component Tests

Tests individual React components in isolation.

### End-to-End Tests

Tests the full application workflow, simulating user interactions with the quiz interface.
